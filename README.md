# University Data Management System

## <span style="color: green;">Project Completion 100%</span>

Hey there! Welcome to my College Data Management System project repo. This project is my playground to showcase my data engineering skills â€“ a mix of database magic, scripting wizardry, and Java charm.

## What's Inside?

- **Database Design:** Crafted a slick Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out the database schema.
  
- **SQL Implementation:** Got my hands dirty with Oracle SQL to shape the database tables.

- **Data Population:** Sprinkled some Python magic to bring the database to life with realistic data.

- **PL/SQL:** Added some spice with functions, procedures, and triggers for a snazzy database.

- **Bash Script:** Cooked up a nifty Bash script for keeping an eye on disk usage and doing monthly backups.

- **Java Application:** Built a swanky Java desktop app â€“ think student enrollment, grading, and eye-catching data visuals.
